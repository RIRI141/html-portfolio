<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Ryoga Ishii. From Japan. I was born December 17th.</p>

<p>I graduated from Aoyama Gakuin University. And I'm gonna enter CICCC in May.</p>

<p>Why I became a Web Developer?? It's because I did a mistake. I did not put much effort into finding a job and was not satisfied with the results. So I decided to study web development in a foreign country, Canada.
